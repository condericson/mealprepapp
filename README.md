Prepper
A meal preparation application designed to assist with organizing meals on a weekly basis, provide search results using keywords from Yummly's API for recipes that can be added to the weekly view, to allow users to upload their own recipes to the weekly view, and to create a grocery list using the ingredients of the recipes in the week for ease of shopping.

This was created as a capstone project, part of Thinkful flexible bootcamp program (https://www.thinkful.com/), for demonstrating proficiency with creating full-stack web applications.

Description
Concert Finder combines the database of available concerts by artist and organizes them to easily compare dates and times that consumers can choose from. When a upcoming event has been chosen, the consumer can click to display a map to the location of the concert. This application removes the hassle consumers face when comparing multiple venues and their locations. The app provides consumers with one webpage that allows them to compare the destinations of all upcoming events for the artist.
